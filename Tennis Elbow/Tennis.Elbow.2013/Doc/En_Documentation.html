<ul>
  <li>If you want to play over the Internet, check you have DirectX 9.0c (or later
    version), else you might experience insane lags! You can download it there
    : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx</a></li>
  <li>if you are behind a NAT/Router and if you want to host a game, you'll have
    to forward the UDP port 4321; consult <a href="http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm" target="_blank">http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm</a>
    if you need to know how to forward or open ports on your router : choose your
    router, then choose any game in the list (for example : Quake 3), it doesn't
    matter which one, just be sure to use the UDP port 4321 instead of what the
    game's listing says to use</li>
  <li> if you have a firewall, you have to open the UDP port 4321, and to allow
    Tennis Elbow to access to Internet</li>
  <li>If you can join other people's games, but no one is joining the games you
    create, then it probably means that you have a router and you didn't configure
    it or it's misconfigured</li>

  <li>On top of the &quot;Network&quot; menu, you can see the TCP/IP interfaces
    detected by the game. You can scroll them to know your different IP addresses,
    but this choice has no incidence on the connection created, which is done
    on all available interfaces at the same time</li>
  <li>Port : 4321 by default; you can set another port if needed, but the port
    must be the same on the host and the client (except if you join a remote game
    by specifying an address completed by a port number, for example : 192.168.0.1:4000
    ); you can put &quot;-1&quot; to randomly choose a port when creating a game,
    or scanning all ports when joining a remote game</li>
  <li>Host game : create a game and wait for a player to join</li>
  <li>Join game : to search for Internet games, local games, or join a specific
    remote game</li>
  <li>Your level : show your approximate level to help you to find opponent of
    your level and have more fun during your online matches</li>
  <li>ELO : your ELO-type score</li>
  <li>Games : number of games you played</li>
  <li> Give Up Rate : is displayed after the Number of Games played; example :
    &quot;Games: 50 -10%&quot; means a player played 50 games, and gave up 10%
    of these games, so a total of 5 games</li>

  <li>Refresh list : refresh the list</li>
  <li>Hide unavailable games : set this to &quot;Yes&quot; to hide all games you
    cannot enter (because your ping is too high, because they don't allow Trial
    version to join them, etc...)</li>
  <li>The ping is an estimation of the round trip time of a packet between 2 computers.
    The smaller, the more the communication will be fast. If the displayed ping
    is &quot;oo&quot;, then the communication was not possible. It can be because
    of a lost packet if it happens once, or because of a misconfigured firewall
    or router if it happens every time</li>

<p>Once you created a game, and waiting for a player to join, you can swap to
  another application. Tennis Elbow will play a warning sound as soon as a player
  joins your game. </p>
<p>On the next screen, you have to set the &quot;Delay&quot;. If you're not sure how to choose it, set it to
  &quot;Auto&quot;, wait about 5 seconds, then click on &quot;Play&quot;.</p>
<p>The Delay is the latency time that Tennis Elbow adds between the time you actionnate
  your controller (keyboard, gamepad, etc...) to move your player, and the time
  this information is actually processed to make your player move. This allows
  keeping both PCs synchronized. In short, the higer the Delay, the more latency
  it'll have between the time you give a command and the time your player will
  react.</p>
<p>The Delay is an internal latency which allows Tennis Elbow to run in parallel on your PC and your opponent's one. There's a aiming dead time which lasts half of the Delay, just before you hit the ball. During that time, the game considers you're pressing left (or right) if you were pressing left (or right) just before the start of that aiming dead time ; on the opposite, the game considers you're pressing nothing if you were pressing nothing just before the start of the dead time. Concretely, it means if you press left to aim to the left, and that you release left just before hitting the ball, your aiming won't come back to the center like when you're playing against the computer. So you need to prepare your aiming at the right time because you won't be able to fix an overaiming at the last instant, especially when you play with a high delay. Note that it's also the recommended way to do while playing against the computer, to have a consistent aiming.</p>
<p>In short : when the Delay is high, the game won't detect your shot selection and your aiming if you don't prepare your strike early enough.</p>
<p>  To have the game running at a normal speed, the Delay must be at least half
  of the ping. For example, if you usually have a maximum ping of 100ms with your
opponent, then you must set the Delay to 50ms or more.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="JoinOnlineGame" id="JoinOnlineGame"></a>Join a game:</strong></font></p>
<p> When you join a game, you just have to wait for the host to set the Delay and launch the game. To know
  the Delay set by the host, you can press F4 during the game to see the match statistics : the Delay is shown
  on the bottom right.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="DuringNetworkGame"></a>During the game:</strong></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>if a turtle appears on the top left of the screen : it means the game is
    waiting for a packet from the remote PC, and possibly, this packet has been
    lost</li>
  <li>if a wire with a red cross appears : it means that one or more packets have
    been lost</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="NameProtection"></a>Name protection:</strong></font></p>
<p>The users who purchased the full version of the game have their online nickname protected. If someone else
  tries to use their nickname, it'll be prefixed by &quot;[Fake] &quot;.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="ELO"></a>ELO:</strong></font></p>
<p>The ELO score gives an approximation of your level of play compared to all other players. Its goal is to
  help you to find other players who are more or less as good as you, to play more interesting matches. Its
  goal is not to determine who is the best Tennis Elbow player, because it's way too much approximated. You
  need to play around 50-100 matches to have an accurate enough score.</p>
<p>The better the player you beat, and the less games
    you lose, the most ELO points you will get ; this ELO-type score can raise
    when you lose against a more good player than you, if you won a lot of games
    (example: 6/7), and can lower when you win against a more weak player than
you, if you lost a lot of games (example: 7/6)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="EloPenalty"></a>ELO Penalty:</strong></font></p>
<p>If you quit before the end of the match, you'll get a 3% penalty to your ELO.
  But if for more than 1 minute your opponent swaps to another application or
  stays in the menus or watches the replay, you can quit without penalty, if you
  passed this minute in the game, without opening the menus, nor swapped to another
  application, nor watched the replay.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="Desynchronization"></a>Desynchronization:</strong></font></p>
<p>Sometimes, when you play online, you'll see the message &quot;Desynchronization
  detected&quot;. It means your game and your opponent game lost their synchronization,
  and different things happened on your computer and their computer. In such case,
  the games will be resynchronized, and you'll have to replay the point.</p>
<p>In case you have a lot of desynchronizations (ie: more than 1 every 5 points),
  it probably means that you and/or your opponent installed a Mod that changes the way

<p> <font color="#0000FF"><strong>How to play ?</strong></font></p>
<p> <u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="aiming" id="aiming"></a></strong></font>Movements, strikes &amp; aiming:</u></p>
<p> When you press no button, push the joystick (or the arrow keys) in the direction you want to run.<br>
  When you press the buttons, your player moves slowly to the ideal position, and the more you push the Joystick
  on the left (or the right), the more the ball will go to the left (or the right).</p>
<p> ==&gt;&gt; <strong><font color="#FF0000">You must keep the button(s) pressed when you hit the ball !</font></strong></p>
<p> When you don't give any special direction, the ball goes to the center of the opposite side.</p>
<p>The closer you are from the net, the faster you'll aim to the left or the right. Therefore, you need only
  a tiny fraction of second to send the ball on the line when you stand at net, while you'll need 2 or 3 times
  more time when you stand several meters after the baseline.</p>
<p> At the net, when the ball is too far away of your player, press the button to make him jump toward the
  ball.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="accuracy" id="accuracy"></a></strong></font>Strike accuracy:</u></p>
<p>The more you hold the button early, the more your strike will be accurate. Indeed, if you press the button
  at the very last moment, your ball could go to a very wide zone, but if you press 1 second early, the zone
  will be very noticeably smaller.</p>
<p>You can see the aiming &amp; accuracy zone when your &quot;Preview&quot; is
  set to &quot;All + Danger Zone + Aiming&quot;. In this case, you'll see in real
  time the spot your aiming at, as well as the zone around where the ball can
  go.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="depth" id="depth"></a></strong></font>Strike
  depth:</u></p>
<p>The more you prepare early, the more :</p>
<ul>
  <li> short strikes (including dropshot) will be short</li>
  <li>other strikes will be long</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you don't center the ball or if you're mispositioned, your short strikes
  will be more long, and your other strikes will be more short.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="danger" id="danger"></a></strong></font>Danger Zone:</u></p>
<p>At tennis, when the ball is rising, just after the rebound, it's harder to hit it, especially when it's
  fast. The zone where it's dangerous to hit the ball is displayed when your &quot;Preview&quot; is set to
  &quot;All + Danger Zone&quot; or above.</p>
<p>If you strike the ball while you stand in the red part of the &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, you might lose control
  of the ball and send it either in the net or too long.</p>
<p>If you stand in the orange part, then you might lose accuracy on your strike, and you'll see the aiming
  zone getting bigger (if you have set the &quot;Preview&quot; on &quot;All + Danger Zone + Aiming&quot;).</p>
<p>Moreover, standing in the red or orange part will make you lose some power on your strike, especially when
  you try to do accelerations.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="center" id="center"></a></strong></font>Center the ball:</u></p>
<p>At tennis, it's very important to strike the ball with the center of the cords, on the side of your body.
  If you try to strike the ball when it's coming onto your body, it's a lot harder to do a good shot.</p>
<p>For this reason, when you want to do an acceleration, a dropshot or a volley, you must be very careful on
  your positioning, else you could lose the control of the ball, or lose some accuracy, depending of the scale
  of your positioning mistake, exactly in the same way than when you position yourself in the red part of the
  &quot;Danger Zone&quot;.</p>
<p>But to off center the ball gives also some handicaps on other strikes : usually, it'll make you do a shorter
  strike if you try to do a normal strike, and a longer strike if you try to do a short strike. You can also
  lose some power in your strike, especially when you do an acceleration.</p>
<p>When you miss a shot, sending the ball out or in the net, an icon with a player striking the ball will appear
  in a corner of the screen to show if you off centered the ball or not :</p>
<ul>
  <li>if the background of the icon is red, then it means you stroke the ball with your body</li>
  <li>if it's orange, it means you mildly off centered the ball</li>
  <li>if it's green, it means you well centered the ball</li>
</ul>
<p><u><a name="lob" id="lob"></a>Lob &amp; Dropshot:</u></p>
<p>The lob and the dropshot are done in the same way than the other strikes, but if you try to do them on a
  too fast incoming ball, then you'll send the ball longer than expected.</p>
<p>Moreover, when you do a lob while running too fast, you send the ball in the same direction than your run.</p>
<p><u><a name="arcade" id="arcade"></a>Arcade,
  Simulation &amp; Elite Controls:</u></p>
<p>By default, the controls are in Simulation mode, but if you feel the game is
  too hard, that you do too much random faults, then you can swap the controls
  to Arcade mode, from the icon in the Character Sheet of your player. In this
  case, the power &amp; accuracy losses because of positioning mistakes in the
  &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and off center ball strikes are divided by 2. Moreover,
  the rate at which the aiming zone decreases is doubled, therefore after half
  of second of strike preparation in Arcade mode you'll get the same accuracy
  than after one second in the Simulation mode. Turning on Arcade mode for your
  player doesn't apply it to the CPU player(s).</p>
<p>On the opposite, if the game is too easy for you, or if you wish to have more
  errors, then you can swap to Elite mode. In this mode, the effects of the Danger
  Zone are stronger and the precision of the aiming zone is lowered. When you
  turn on this for your player, it'll also apply to the CPU player(s), so it'll
  give you a fair match.</p>
<p><u><a name="serving" id="serving"></a>Service:</u></p>
<p> The service is executed with the same method than the other shots, with a slight difference: whatever the
  buttons combination, a push-up causes a slice and a push-down causes a top spin effect. You can move your
  player to the left or to the right to find a special angle for your service.</p>
<p> You can also release your button(s) slightly before striking the ball on   your serve ; when doing serve &amp; volley, this technique will allow you to reach the net slightly more easily ; to use that feature, release the pressed button(s), then release the direction (if needed) and then push forward (+ left/right if needed) ; it also works for walking backward, but in that case, the effectiveness is quite lowered.</p>
<p><u><a name="score" id="score"></a>Score:</u></p>
<p> The player 1's score is written in the upper slots of the score blackboard,
  and the player 2's score is written in the bottom slots. If the little ball
  is in the upper slot, then it's the player 1 who serves, else it's the player
  2.</p>
<p><u><a name="trace" id="trace"></a>Ball Trace:</u></p>
<p> If in the character sheet &quot;Preview&quot; is set to &quot;Service&quot; or above, then during the service,
  the ball's impact mark is shown early to help you.<br>
  If &quot;Preview&quot; is set to &quot;Service + Rally&quot; or above, then during rallies, the ball's impact
  mark is shown early to help you.</p>
<p><u><a name="shoulder" id="shoulder"></a>Shoulder height  acceleration:</u></p>
<p>When you do an acceleration while the ball is around your shoulder height, you get an extra bonus speed to your strike. This bonus is more or less big depending of :</p>
<ul>
  <li>your player style (see player style section for details)</li>
  <li>the height difference from your shoulder height, except for 2-handed backhand whose sweetspot is slightly lower, and 1-hand backhand's one even a bit lower</li>
  <li>your preparation time, the longer the better</li>
  <li>the ball shouldn't be raising anymore, or it should advance very slowly</li>
  <li>you do your strike with 1 hand or 2 hands, which gives from fastest to slowest : 1H-FH, 2H-FH, 2H-BH, 1H-BH</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="tiredness" id="tiredness"></a></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Tiredness:</strong></font></p>
<p>If in your character sheet &quot;Tiredness&quot; is <strong>off</strong> then your player will get tired only from his acceleration strikes.</p>
<p>You have a limited number of good accelerations per point, which depends of your stamina percentage. Once
	you used them all, your accelerations will become more and more imprecise &amp; powerless each time your
	try to do one more. When you strike your last good acceleration and the next ones, some smoke evades your
	racket to indicate it.</p>
<p>If in your character sheet &quot;Tiredness&quot; is <strong>on</strong> then your player will get tired from his strikes &amp;
running.</p>
<p>During the match, you'll see 2 bars on the screen to help you to track your tiredness :</p>
<ul>
  <li> Top one = Instant Energy</li>
  <li> Bottom one = Overall Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic behavior is :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Instant Energy goes down &amp; up quite quickly</li>
  <li>The Overall Energy goes down a lot less quickly &amp; up even less quickly</li>
  <li> The Instant Energy can't go up higher than the current level of the Overall Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>You lose energy when :</p>
<ul>
  <li> you run ; the more you Speed is above your Stamina, the quicker you lose energy ; the more you Stamina
    is above your Speed, the slower you lose energy ; so running at your full speed with 100% in both Stamina
    &amp; Speed makes you lose energy at the same rate than running at your full speed with 0% in both skills
    ; the faster you run, the quicker you lose energy</li>
  <li> you strike an acceleration ; the higher your Stamina is, the less energy you lose when doing accelerations
    ; if you have a playing style that gives a number of acceleration bonus (example: Power Baseliner) then
    you get a bit less tired from doing an acceleration</li>
  <li> you do a normal strike ; but very very less tiring than doing acceleration ; putting a lot of topspin
    in the ball is more tiring</li>
</ul>
<p>The more your Instant Energy bar goes under 20%, the more :</p>
<ul>
  <li> you lose precision on your strikes, especially accelerations</li>
  <li> you lose power on your acceleration, but not on any other strikes</li>
  <li> your max run speed lowers &amp; your run acceleration lowers</li>
</ul>
<p>The more your Overall Energy bar goes under 50%, the more :</p>
<ul>
  <li> you lose a bit of precision on your strikes</li>
  <li> your max run speed lowers &amp; your run acceleration lowers</li>
</ul>
<p>You get back energy :</p>
<ul>
  <li> a bit after each point</li>
  <li> a bit more at each change of ends, which occurs every 2 games ; but there's
    no pause at the end change occurring after the 1st game of the set, thus the
    restoration is lower</li>
  <li>even a bit more during the pause after the set ends, either there's a end
    change or not</li>
</ul>
<p>When your Instant Energy is below 25%, you get some back during rally if you stand still, but it goes up
  very slowly.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> if you lower the number of games per set, your Overall Energy will go down more quickly, to simulate a 6-game set</li>
	<li>strikes are a bit more tiring when  power is above stamina, and a bit   less tiring when power is below stamina, especially for accelerations</li>

<p> <u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="rally" id="rally"></a></strong></font>Forehand &amp; Backhand:</u></p>
<p>The higher your power is, the stronger you hit the ball, especially on the normal strike, the topspin and
  the accelerations.</p>
<p>The higher your consistency is, the more you can strike the ball in a difficult situation (low, fast or
  high ball) without accuracy handicap.</p>
<p>The precision skill is relative to the power one. For example, having 60% in power and 70% in precision
  will give you as much precision in your strikes as having 30% in power and 40% in precision.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more your precision is above your power, the less time you need to prepare your strike to
  make it accurate. And the more your precision is below your power, the more time you need to prepare your
  strike to make it accurate.</p>
<p>Having precision above power also increases the effectiveness &amp; speed of your short strike &amp; short acceleration.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="2hand" id="2hand"></a></strong></font>1-handed vs 2-handed strikes:</u></p>
<p>Compared to the 1-handed forehand &amp; backhand, the 2-handed backhand &amp; forehand are :</p>
<ul>
  <li>a bit less powerful : you hit your strikes with a bit less speed</li>
  <li>a bit less wide : you have to go closer of the ball to strike it</li>
  <li>a bit more safe : you get a bit less handicap by striking balls in the orange and red part of the Danger
    Zone, so often, your shot is a bit more accurate</li>
  <li> better to counter powerful shots : you get 15 more points in your counter skill</li>
</ul>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="service" id="service"></a></strong></font>Service:</u></p>
<p>Like the forehand and the backhand, the service precision is relative to its power: having 80% in power
  and 70% in precision will give you as much precision in your serve as having 50% in power and 40% in precision.</p>
<p>When you serve using b1+b2, you try to do your fastest serve possible. If you power is equal to your consistency,
  then you have 70% chances of success. If your power is above your consistency, then you have less than 70%
  chances of success, and in the opposite case, you have more than 70% chances of success.</p>
<p>When you serve using b2, you have 100% chances of success ; the speed of your serve depends of your power,
  and the difference between your power and your consistency.</p>
<p>When you serve using b1, you do a serve between the b1+b2 &amp; b2 ones. If your power and your consistency
  are equals, then you have 85% chances of success.</p>
<p>The average maximal speed of your serve depends mainly of your power:</p>

<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="volley" id="volley"></a></strong></font>Volley &amp; Smash:</u></p>
<p>Depending of the strike you do, the Net Presence skill is combined with the volley forehand, volley backhand
  or smash skill, to define the precision and the consistency of your strike. The power doesn't depend of the
  Net Presence.</p>
<p>Except that, the volleys &amp; smashes work like the forehands and backhands from the baseline.</p>
<p>Moreover, the higher your Net Presence is, the more you can run while striking the ball without getting
  any handicap. </p>
<p>When you play at the net, you need to have high volley skills if you want to strike winners that overwhelm
  your opponent. Also, the normal strike at the net is only a ball pushing, which often will be too slow to
  be out of your opponent reach, even if it's well placed. If you want to do winning volleys, you should use
  the acceleration, but only on easy balls, i.e. not too high, not too low nor too fast, else you might do
  a fault.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="dropshot" id="dropshot"></a></strong></font>Lob &amp; Dropshot:</u></p>
<p>The lob and dropshot skills define your ability to do lobs and dropshots, but each skill is balanced with
  the skills of the forehand or the backhand, depending if you're doing a forehand or a backhand.</p>
<p>The higher this balanced skill is, the more you'll keep the control of the fast incoming balls, being able
  to normally execute your strike, without sending the ball too long.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="counter" id="counter"></a></strong></font>Counter:</u></p>
<p>The counter skill is the ability to use the incoming ball speed to send it back faster. So the counter skill
  gives you a speed bonus of up to 7.5 km/h on your normal and topspin strikes when the ball is coming really
  fast.</p>
<p>Moreover, the higher your counter skill is, the less you are constrained by fast incoming balls, but the
  slow incoming balls are also a bit less easy for you.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="topspin" id="topspin"></a></strong></font>Topspin:</u></p>
<p>The topspin is the effect from down to up given to the ball by the racket during the strike, which makes
  it spin quickly on itself. Topspin balls have more curved trajectories, with a higher and quicker rebound
  which forces your opponent to step back. But beware, the topspin has very little effect on fast surface,
  especially on grass.</p>
<p>The higher your topspin skill is, the more you will give topspin on your strikes, especially with the normal
  strike, the topspin strike and the acceleration. A topspin ball gives more accuracy on length, but it loses
  some gross speed.</p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="speed" id="speed"></a></strong></font>Speed:</u></p>
<p>The higher your speed is, the more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your maximum speed is high</li>
  <li>you accelerate quickly</li>
  <li>you do big jumps at the net</li>
</ul>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="height" id="height"></a></strong></font>Height:</u></p>
<p>The smaller you are, the more you accelerate quickly. But this bonus is very small, just big enough to compensate
  the difference of wingspan with taller players, so that it doesn't give a handicap to play with a smaller
  player. </p>
<p><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong><a name="stamina" id="stamina"></a></strong></font>Stamina:</u></p>

<p>When you exit Tennis Elbow by clicking on the &quot;Exit&quot; button, your game is automatically saved,
  and you will go on from where you stopped the next time you launch Tennis Elbow.</p>
<p>Moreover, your game is automatically saved over the past 3 weeks of play, over 3 different slots ; therefore,
  in case of problem (ie: if the game crashes or hangs for a reason or another), you will still have the possibility
  to restart from a recent saved game.</p>

  Elbow by clicking on the little cross on top right of the Tennis Elbow window, your current game will be

  <li>you can't create your own player, you have to pick one from the database (you still can edit him, though)</li>
  <li>you can start older than 17 years old, and at end of each season, you'll be asked if you want to go on or stop</li>
  <li> your skills will not go down and you won't earn any experience point, so you won't have to train your skills ; your skills will be changed at each beginning of season (if you agree to), to reflect your chosen player strength during that incoming new year</li>

<p><a name="training" id="training"></a></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Training:</strong></font></p>
<p> In Full Career, before each tournament, the Training screen will pop up; this screen allows you to distribute the experience
  points you won during your previous matches.</p>
<p>For each available day between 2 tournaments, you can do 6 hours of training. Depending of the difficulty
  level, the training hours are more or less effective. Moreover, it needs 2 times more hours and experience
  points to train most of your skills between 60% &amp; 89%, and 3 times more hours and experience points when
  they are between 90% &amp; 99%.</p>
<p> In main draws, for each match won, you earn about 10~20 experience points; for each match lost, you earn
  25 experience points, because defeats teach more than victories..! In qualification draw, these numbers of
  points are divided by 2. Moreover, in easiest levels (ie: Beginner &amp; Club), you'll earn more points,
  and in hardest levels (ie: Master &amp; Incredible), you'll earn less points.</p>
<p> But beware, every week, you lose a few points in your characteristics: if you don't practice, you'll regress
  inexorably. The higher a characteristic is, the faster it'll drop.</p>
<p>The topspin is a special skill, because it's the only one you can choose to lower. Indeed, on fast surface
  the topspin isn't much useful, and so it can be interesting to play a volleyer with a very low topspin.</p>
<p><strong>End of year bonus :</strong> if you don't play during the last week of December (warning: this excludes the qualifications of tournaments happening on 1st week of the next year!), you'll get a small experience bonus, depending of the number of days you didn't play, up to 50 ( = from mid-November), for a total of ~35-45 experience points, depending of the difficulty level.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you win a tournament, it's always on Sunday. And if you start a new tournament
  the following week, often it'll be on Monday: you won't have any free day for training, so that's why you'll
  see 0 available day &amp; hour in the training screen.</p>

<p>Rule 1. Opponents stand on opposite sides of the court. The player who delivers the ball to start the point
  is called the server. The player who stands opposite and cross-court from the server is the receiver.</p>
<p>Rule 2. The server shall stand behind the baseline within the boundaries of the singles court. All even
  points are served from the right part of the server court to the left service box on the opponent's court,
  and odd number points are served from the left part of the server court to the right service box on the opponent's
  court.</p>
<p> Rule 3. If the ball does not land in the service box, it is deemed a fault and a 2nd serve is given. If
  the server misses his target on 2nd serve, he loses the point. If the ball hits the net and goes in the correct
  service box, another serve is granted.</p>
<p>Rule 4. The receiver can stand where he likes, after the service line, but must let the ball bounce in the
  service box.</p>
<p>Rule 5. The server always calls his score first. The 1st point gives a score of 15. The second point is
  called 30. The third point is called 40 and game is won on the 4th point. If the score is 40-40, also known
  as deuce, one side must win by 2 points. The 1st of these 2 points is called Advantage. If the 2nd point
  isn't won by the same team, the score goes back to 40-40.</p>
<p>Rule 6. After the game, the opponents serve. Games equal 1. The first to win
  6 games, by two, wins the set. The first to win 2 sets wins the match (3 sets
  in men Grand Slams and Davis Cup). If the score is 6-6, a tie-breaker is played.
  This is scored by one's. The 1st server serves once, then each team serves twice
  in turn. The first team to score 7 points winning by two wins the set.</p>
<p>Rule 7. If the ball goes into the net, or outside the boundaries of the court, the player who hits that
  ball loses the point. If the ball hits the net during the point and goes into the opponents court, the ball
  is in play.</p>
<p>Rule 8. A ball that lands on the line is good, even if it just partly touches it.</p>
